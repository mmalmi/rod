Unfortunately, we ran into a bunch of catastrophic backtracking issues \n * with certain input text, causing Autolinker to either hang or just take a \n * really long time to parse the string.\n *\n * The current code is intended to be a O(n) algorithm that walks through\n * the string in one pass, and tries to be as cheap as possible. We don't need\n * to implement the full HTML spec, but rather simply determine where the string\n * looks like an HTML tag, and where it looks like text (so that we can autolink\n * that).\n * \n * This state machine parser is intended just to be a simple but performant\n * parser of HTML for the subset of requirements we have. We simply need to:\n *\n * 1. Determine where HTML tags are\n * 2. Determine the tag name (Autolinker specifically only cares about <a>,\n *    <script>, and <style> tags, so as not to link any text within them)\n *\n * We don't need to:\n *\n * 1. Create a parse tree\n * 2. Auto-close tags with invalid markup\n * 3. etc.\n * \n * The other intention behind this is that we didn't want to add external \n * dependencies on the Autolinker utility which would increase its size. For \n * instance, adding htmlparser2 adds 125kb to the minified output file,\n * increasing its final size from 47kb to 172kb (at the time of writing). It \n * also doesn't work exactly correctly, treating the string \"<3 blah blah blah\"\n * as an HTML tag.\n * \n * Reference for HTML spec: \n * \n *     https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/syntax.html#sec-tokenization\n *\n * @param {String} html The HTML to parse\n * @param {Object} callbacks\n * @param {Function} callbacks.onOpenTag Callback function to call when an open\n *   tag is parsed.

Your friends can index and relay your messages, while others can still verify that they were signed by you.\n*\n* Fields: signedData, signer (public key) and signature.\n*\n* signedData has an author, signer, type, time and optionally other fields.\n*\n* signature covers the utf8 string representation of signedData. Since messages are digitally signed, users only need to care about the message signer and not who relayed it or whose index it was found from.\n*\n* signer is the entity that verified its origin. In other words: message author and signer can be different entities, and only the signer needs to use Iris.\n*\n* For example, a crawler can import and sign other people's messages from Twitter. Only the users who trust the crawler will see the messages.\n*\n* \"Rating\" type messages, when added to an SocialNetwork, can add or remove Identities from the web of trust. Verification/unverification messages can add or remove Attributes from an Contact. Other types of messages such as social media \"post\" are just indexed by their author, recipient and time.\n*\n* Constructor: creates a message from the param obj.signedData that must contain at least the mandatory fields: author, recipient, type and time. You can use createRating() and createVerification() to automatically populate some of these fields and optionally sign the message.\n* @param obj\n*\n* @example\n* https://github.com/irislib/iris-lib/blob/master/__tests__/SignedMessage.js\n*\n* Rating message:\n* {\n*   signedData: {\n*     author: {name:'Alice', key:'ABCD1234'},\n*     recipient: {name:'Bob', email:'bob@example.com'},\n*     type: 'rating',\n*     rating: 1,\n*     maxRating: 10,\n*     minRating: -10,\n*     text: 'Traded 1 BTC'\n*   },\n*   signer: 'ABCD1234',\n*   signature: '1234ABCD'\n* }\n*\n* Verification message:\n* {\n*   signedData: {\n*     author: {name:'Alice', key:'ABCD1234'},\n*     recipient: {\n*       name: 'Bob',\n*       email: ['bob@example.com', 'bob.saget@example.com'],\n*       bitcoin: '1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa'\n*     },\n*     type: 'verification'\n*   },\n*   signer: 'ABCD1234',\n*   signature: '1234ABCD'\n* }\n*/\nclass SignedMessage {\n  constructor(obj) {\n    if (obj.signedData) {\n      this.signedData = obj.signedData;\n    }\n    if (obj.pubKey) {\n      this.pubKey = obj.pubKey;\n    }\n    if (obj.sig) {\n      if (typeof obj.sig !== `string`) {\n        throw new ValidationError(`SignedMessage signature must be a string`);\n      }\n      this.sig = obj.sig;\n      this.getHash();\n    }\n    this._validate();\n  }\n\n  static _getArray(authorOrRecipient) {\n    const arr = [];\n    const keys = Object.keys(authorOrRecipient);\n    for (let i = 0;i < keys.length;i++) {\n      const type = keys[i];\n      const value = authorOrRecipient[keys[i]];\n      if (typeof value === `string`) {\n        arr.push(new Attribute(type, value));\n      } else { // array\n        for (let j = 0;j < value.length;j++) {\n          const elementValue = value[j];\n          arr.push(new Attribute(type, elementValue));\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    return arr;\n  }\n\n  static _getIterable(authorOrRecipient) {\n    return {\n      *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n        const keys = Object.keys(authorOrRecipient);\n        for (let i = 0;i < keys.length;i++) {\n          const type = keys[i];\n          const value = authorOrRecipient[keys[i]];\n          if (typeof value === `string`) {\n            yield new Attribute(type, value);\n          } else { // array\n            for (let j = 0;j < value.length;j++) {\n              const elementValue = value[j];\n              yield new Attribute(type, elementValue);\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    };\n  }\n\n  /**\n  * @returns {object} Javascript iterator over author attributes\n  */\n  getAuthorIterable() {\n    return SignedMessage._getIterable(this.signedData.author);\n  }\n\n  /**\n  * @returns {object} Javascript iterator over recipient attributes\n  */\n  getRecipientIterable() {\n    return SignedMessage._getIterable(this.signedData.recipient);\n  }\n\n  /**\n  * @returns {array} Array containing author attributes\n  */\n  getAuthorArray() {\n    return SignedMessage._getArray(this.signedData.author);\n  }\n\n  /**\n  * @returns {array} Array containing recipient attributes\n  */\n  getRecipientArray() {\n    return this.signedData.recipient ?
