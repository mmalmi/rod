Unfortunately, we ran into a bunch of catastrophic backtracking issues \n * with certain input text, causing Autolinker to either hang or just take a \n * really long time to parse the string.\n *\n * The current code is intended to be a O(n) algorithm that walks through\n * the string in one pass, and tries to be as cheap as possible. We don't need\n * to implement the full HTML spec, but rather simply determine where the string\n * looks like an HTML tag, and where it looks like text (so that we can autolink\n * that).\n * \n * This state machine parser is intended just to be a simple but performant\n * parser of HTML for the subset of requirements we have. We simply need to:\n *\n * 1. Determine where HTML tags are\n * 2. Determine the tag name (Autolinker specifically only cares about <a>,\n *    <script>, and <style> tags, so as not to link any text within them)\n *\n * We don't need to:\n *\n * 1. Create a parse tree\n * 2. Auto-close tags with invalid markup\n * 3. etc.\n * \n * The other intention behind this is that we didn't want to add external \n * dependencies on the Autolinker utility which would increase its size. For \n * instance, adding htmlparser2 adds 125kb to the minified output file,\n * increasing its final size from 47kb to 172kb (at the time of writing). It \n * also doesn't work exactly correctly, treating the string \"<3 blah blah blah\"\n * as an HTML tag.\n * \n * Reference for HTML spec: \n * \n *     https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/syntax.html#sec-tokenization\n *\n * @param {String} html The HTML to parse\n * @param {Object} callbacks\n * @param {Function} callbacks.onOpenTag Callback function to call when an open\n *   tag is parsed.

Since messages are digitally signed, users only need to care about the message signer and not who relayed it or whose index it was found from.\n*\n* signer is the entity that verified its origin.

By looking at the unencrypted timestamps (or Gun subscriptions), it is possible to guess who are communicating with each other. This could be improved by indexing messages by *day* only, so making the guess would be more difficult, while you could still return them in a semi-sequential order.\n*\n* @param {Object} options\n* @param {string} options.key your keypair\n* @param {Object} options.gun [gun](https://github.com/amark/gun) instance\n* @param options.participants (optional) string or string array or permissions object ({'pub1':{read:true,write:true,admin:false},'pub2'...}) of participant public keys (your own key is included by default)\n* @param {string} options.chatLink (optional) chat link instead of participants list\n* @param {string} options.uuid (group channels only) unique channel identifier.
